>> What is an Array?

>>> An array is a collection of items of same data type stored 
at contiguous memory locations. 

>>Is the array always of fixed size?
>>>array has has a fixed size which is allocated when array is created

>>Types of indexing in an array
>>>
   .) 0 (zero-based indexing): The first element of the array is indexed by a subscript of 0.
   .) 1 (one-based indexing): The first element of the array is indexed by the subscript of 1.
   .) n (N-based indexing): The base index of an array can be freely chosen.
>>how an array can be initialized ?
>>>
   1. Passing no value within the initializer
        e.g.
            int arr[ 5 ] = {  };
   2. By passing specific values within the initializer
        e.g.
           int arr[ 5 ] = { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 };
   3. By passing specific values within the initializer but not declaring the size
        e.g.
           int arr[  ] = { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 };
   4. Universal Initialization 
       (can avoid "=" sign)
       e.g.
           int arr[ ]  { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 };
>>What are the different operations on the array?
>>>
   1. Insertion in Array
      Pseudo Code:

      // to insert a value= 10 at index position 2;

        arr[ 2 ] = 10;
      
      Time Complexity: 

     # O(1) to insert a single element
     # O(N) to insert all the array elements [where N is the size of the array]
    
    
   2. Access elements in Array

       // to access array element at index position 2, we simply can write

          return arr[ 2 ] ;
     
   3. Searching in Array

      Pseudo Code:

     // searching for value 2 in the array;

          Loop from i = 0 to 5:
         check if  arr[i] = 2:
          return true;

Types of arrays : 
One dimensional array (1-D arrays)
Multidimensional array


Quick Questions;
1. What is an array in data structure with example?

An array is a collection of items of the same data type stored 
at contiguous memory locations. 
Ex. int arr[5] = {1,2,3,4,5};



2. What are the 3 types of arrays?

Indexed arrays
Multidimensional arrays
Associative arrays(DICTONARY)

3. What data structure is an array?

An array is a LINER DATA structure.

4. Difference between array and structure?

The structure can contain variables of different types 
but an array only contain variables of the same type.
